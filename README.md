## Motivation

Recently, to do data mining on financial data features. I have taught myself machine learning, mainly traditional statistical-based machine learning (book: An-Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning) and deep learning based on neural networks (from Hung-yi Lee https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~ tlkagk/courses.html). I also studied reinforcement learning, but I found some of the concepts difficult to understand, and I think it is one of the most challenging kinds of machine learning to understand. So I haven't actually used it yet.

I used to do very intensive research on malware in my last bank and my university days. When I discovered that machine learning is a powerful tool for data analysis, I thought: why can't I use machine learning to detect malware?

## Instruction

This notebook is mainly based on an existed notebook(https://github.com/dchad/malware-detection), and the data comes from Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge (BIG 2015)(https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data), which data quality is high.

Why I do my research based on Derek's notebook? Because the workload of analyzing this data from scratch is enormous, I will use his method directly and go through the advantages and disadvantages to speed up the analysis.

## Conclusion

Even when the feature extraction stage is not done in great detail, the accuracy of these mainstream models can be greater than 99%, and can machine learning is very powerful for malware identification.
